### Assignment
> Review several architectures, including, but not limited to, the links below and create and be prepared to discuss your own  standard architecture, include at least Synapse and Purview.

**This customer case doesn't contain all the information you would have in a real-world scenario, thus feel free to add your own creativity. If you want to have your architecture reviewed, you can post it in the Teams community.**
